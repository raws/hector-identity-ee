hector-identity-ee is an [ExpressionEngine](http://expressionengine.com/) 1.7 identity adapter for [Hector](http://github.com/sstephenson/hector).

### Installation and usage

Copy `lib/expression_engine/ext.hector_identity_adapter.php` to your ExpressionEngine installation's `system/extensions` directory, then enable it by navigating to Admin > Utilities > Extensions Manager. Upon activation, the extension will generate safe usernames in the `exp_members.hector_username` column for all existing and future members. A user should log in to Hector using his or her `hector_username`.

Install hector-auth-ee with RubyGems and navigate to your server:

    $ gem install hector-identity-ee
    ...
    $ cd myserver.hect

Create `config/expression_engine.yml`:

    database:
      host: mysql.myserver.com
      user: hector
      password: s3cr3t
      database: expression_engine

Optionally limit logins to members of specific groups by adding a `groups` key:

    groups:
      - 1 # Admins
      - 6 # Moderators

You can connect Hector to hector-identity-ee by modifying `init.rb` in your server's directory:

    require "hector/ee_identity_adapter"
    Hector::Identity.adapter = Hector::ExpressionEngineIdentityAdapter.new
