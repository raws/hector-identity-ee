hector-identity-ee is an [ExpressionEngine](http://expressionengine.com/) 2.x identity adapter for [Hector](http://github.com/sstephenson/hector).

### Installation and usage

Installing and configuring hector-identity-ee is simple.

#### ExpressionEngine

Clone hector-identity-ee to `system/expressionengine/third_party/hector`, then enable it by navigating to Add-Ons > Extensions.

The extension will generate safe usernames and passwords in the `exp_members.hector_username` and `exp_members.hector_password` columns for all existing and future members. A user should log in to Hector using his or her `hector_username` and `hector_password`.

You can display the currently logged in user's Hector credentials in a template using `{exp:hector:username}` and `{exp:hector:password}`. To display a particular member's Hector username or password, add a `member_id` parameter: `{exp:hector:username member_id="16"}`.

#### Hector

Install the [hector-identity-ee gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/hector-identity-ee) and navigate to your server:

    $ gem install hector-identity-ee
    ...
    $ cd myserver.hect

Create `config/expression_engine.yml`:

    database:
      host: mysql.myserver.com
      username: hector
      password: s3cr3t
      database: expression_engine
      prefix: exp # optional, defaults to "exp"

Optionally limit logins to members of specific groups by adding a `groups` key:

    groups:
      - 1 # Admins
      - 6 # Moderators

You can connect Hector to hector-identity-ee by modifying `init.rb` in your server's directory:

    require "hector/ee_identity_adapter"
    Hector::Identity.adapter = Hector::ExpressionEngineIdentityAdapter.new
